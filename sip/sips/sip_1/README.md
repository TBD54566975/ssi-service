# SSI Improvement Proposal

# What is a SIP?

All feature proposal documents for the SSI Service follow a common format and are known as SSI Improvement Proposals or SIPs. Features must list a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) and follow the [template here](../SIP_Template.md). Discussion is encouraged on GitHub issues, pull requests, and optionally [on our forums](https://forums.tbd.website/).

## SIP Status

Features each have a status which can be one of the following, inspired by the [BIP process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki):

- **Idea** – An idea that is not quite a draft and exists as a GitHub issue. Needs feedback and discussion.
- **Draft** – A formal proposal for a feature addition, submitted as a Pull Request against a new *SIP directory*. Requires feedback, discussion, and approval from a quorum of maintainers before acceptance.
- **Rejected** – A terminal state for a proposal. Possible reasons include deciding to go in a different direction, not a good fit, or the proposal being withdrawn or cancelled by the submitter.
- **Accepted** – A terminal state for a proposal. Proposals that are accepted may begin to be developed against.

## Taking a SIP

When your idea is ready for a draft clone this repository, create a new SIP following the [template](../sip_template.md), create, a new entry in the `sip/sips` directory, and add the document to table below, and open up a pull request.
