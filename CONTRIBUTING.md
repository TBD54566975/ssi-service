## Development Prerequisites

___***UPDATE TABLE OF PROJECT DEPS AND INSTALLATION NOTES***___

| Requirement | Tested Version | Installation Instructions                            |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Go          | 1.17.6         |[go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/compile-install) |
| Mage        | 1.12.1         |[magefile.org](https://magefile.org/)                 |
| Java        | 17.0.2         | Below, recommended via [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io)   |

### Go

This project is written in Go, a modern, open source programming language.

You may verify your `go` installation via the terminal:

```
$> go version
go version go1.17.6 darwin/amd64
```

If you do not have go, we recommend installing it by:

#### MacOS

##### Homebrew

```
$> brew install go
```

### Mage

The build is run by Mage.

You may verify your `mage` installation via the terminal:

```
$> mage --version
Mage Build Tool 1.12.1
Build Date: 2021-12-15T21:00:02Z
Commit: 2f1ec40
built with: go1.17.6
```

#### MacOS

##### Homebrew

```
$> brew install mage
```

### Java

This project is written in Java, a typesafe, compiled programming language.

You may verify your `java` installation via the terminal by running `java -version`.

If you do not have Java, we recommend installing it via [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/install). This is a project which
will allow you to easily install the Java Development Kit (JDK), runtime (JRE), and related frameworks, build tools, and
runtimes.

After you've installed SDKMan, you may install Java:

#### SDKMan (cross-platform instructions)

```shell
$> sdk install java 
 ...
Do you want java 17.0.2-open to be set as default? (Y/n): Y
Setting java 17.0.2-open as default.
```

You may test your installation:

```shell
$> java -version
openjdk version "17.0.2" 2022-01-18
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.2+8-86)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.2+8-86, mixed mode, sharing)
```

---
**NOTE**

You may additionally look for other Java versions to install by running `sdk list java`:

...or other installation candidates like Apache Ant, Apache Maven, etc, by running `sdk list`.

Consult the SDKMan documentation for more info.

## Build (Mage)

```
$> mage build
```

## Build (Java / Gradle)

### macOS / Linux

```shell
$> ./gradlew build
```

### Windows

```shell
$> gradlew.bat build
```

## Test (Mage)

```
$> mage test
```

## Test (Java / Gradle)

### macOS / Linux

```shell
$> ./gradlew test
```

### Windows

```shell
$> gradlew.bat test
```

---
**NOTE**

You may also combine Gradle build targets in one call, like:

```shell
$> ./gradlew clean build test
```

## Contribution

We review contributions to the codebase via GitHub's Pull Request mechanism. We have the following guidelines to ease
your experience and help our leads respond quickly to your valuable work:

* Start by proposing a change either in Issues (most appropriate for small change requests or bug fixes) or in
  Discussions (most appropriate for design and architecture considerations, proposing a new feature, or where you'd like
  insight and feedback)
* Cultivate consensus around your ideas; the project leads will help you pre-flight how beneficial the proposal might be
  to the project. Developing early buy-in will help others understand what you're looking to do, and give you a a
  greater chance of your contributions making it into the codebase! No one wants to see work done in an area that's
  unlikely to be incorporated into the codebase.
* Fork the repo into your own namespace/remote
* Work in a dedicated feature branch. Atlassian wrote a
  great [description of this workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
* When you're ready to offer your work to the project, first:
* Squash your commits into a single one (or an appropriate small number of commits), and rebase atop the upstream `main`
  branch. This will limit the potential for merge conflicts during review, and helps keep the audit trail clean. A good
  writeup for how this is done
  is [here](https://medium.com/@slamflipstrom/a-beginners-guide-to-squashing-commits-with-git-rebase-8185cf6e62ec), and
  if you're having trouble - feel free to ask a member or the community for help or leave the commits as-is, and flag
  that you'd like rebasing assistance in your PR! We're here to support you.
* Open a PR in the project to bring in the code from your feature branch.
* The maintainers noted in the `CODEOWNERS` file will review your PR and optionally open a discussion about its contents
  before moving forward.
* Remain responsive to follow-up questions, be open to making requested changes, and...
* You're a contributor!
* And remember to respect everyone in our global development community. Guidelines are established in
  our `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
