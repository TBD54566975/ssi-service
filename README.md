# $PROJECT_NAME README

Congrats, project leads! You got a new project to grow!

This stub is meant to help you form a strong community around your work. It's yours to adapt, and may diverge from this
initial structure. Just keep the files seeded in this repo, and the rest is yours to evolve!

## Introduction

Orient users to the project here. This is a good place to start with an assumption that the user knows very little - so
start with the Big Picture and show how this project fits into it. It may be good to reference/link the broader
architecture in the
`collaboration` repo or the developer site here.

Then maybe a dive into what this project does.

Diagrams and other visuals are helpful here. Perhaps code snippets showing usage.

Project leads should complete, alongside this `README`:

* [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS) - set project lead(s)
* [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) - Fill out how to: install prereqs, build, test, run, access CI, chat, discuss,
  file issues

The other files in this template repo may be used as-is:

* [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md)
* [LICENSE](./LICENSE)
